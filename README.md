Built a simple image edge detection project using convolution, ReLU activation, and max pooling in TensorFlow. 🖼️
This hands-on implementation gave me a much deeper understanding of how CNNs extract features from images — from detecting edges to capturing patterns that form the foundation of complex image recognition tasks.
Seeing my network highlight edges in real time was super satisfying! ✨ It’s amazing how a few layers can start “seeing” an image almost like humans do.
Excited to take this further and explore advanced CNN architectures, transfer learning, and real-world computer vision applications. 🚀
If you’re starting with CNNs, I highly recommend building a small project like this — it really makes the theory click.
